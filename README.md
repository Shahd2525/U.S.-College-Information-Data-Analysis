Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing the U.S. College Information Dataset, which contains detailed data on 6,429 higher education institutions across the United States. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and includes information such as student demographics, location, institutional details, and other academic factors.

The notebook’s main goal is to prepare, clean, and explore the dataset to uncover insights and trends within U.S. colleges, which can later support data-driven decision-making or predictive modeling.

Key Steps in the Project

Setup & Libraries

Install and import key Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and missingno.

Configure visualization themes for consistent plotting.

Data Loading

Load the dataset: U.S._College_information_Real_dataset.csv.

Preview the first few rows of the data.

Data Inspection

Check dataset info and structure.

Generate descriptive statistics for both numerical and categorical features.

Data Cleaning

Rename columns for readability (e.g., Unnamed: 0 → Student_Id, zip → zip_code).

Address missing values with the help of missingno visualizations.

Standardize and prepare data for deeper analysis.

Goal of the Project

The purpose of this analysis is to explore U.S. college data, clean it for inconsistencies, and set the foundation for deeper studies such as:

Comparing institutions by region, size, or type.

Identifying trends in student demographics and educational opportunities.

Preparing the dataset for future modeling (e.g., clustering or predictive analysis).
